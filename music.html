        <h3 class="info"></br></br>If you're someone who knows me well, you'll probably know that I listen to Jay Chou </br>most of the time hahaha.
        </br></br></br>It's truly quite amazing how I've been listening to his songs since my early primary school days and still haven't gotten sick of it 10+ years later LOL.
        </br></br></br>I couldn't decide what my favourite song is, hence I took the courtesy to include 2 songs that I really like :)</h3>

        </br><h3 class="info">I remember how my chinese teacher would play his songs in class in a bid to get students to like the language, good times indeed...
        </br></br></br>Anyway back to the topic. I guess other than Jay Chou being a constant the other stuff that I listen to are mostly pretty random and
        very much depends on my mood.</br></br></br>I listen to Bach quite regularly (Air on a G String, Goldberg Variations) as well as the occasional Linkin Park. Oh, the Naruto Shippuden
        openings are really good too</br>(Diver, Silhouette and Pino To Ameri).</br></br></br>I think that's about it from me. Thanks for reading!</h3>
